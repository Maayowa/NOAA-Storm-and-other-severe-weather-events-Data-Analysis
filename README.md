# NOAA-Storm-and-other-severe-weather-events-Data-Analysis


The basic goal of this project is to explore the data of Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

The two questions this Analysis would answer are: 1. Which types of events are most harmful to population health? 
                                                  2. Which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
